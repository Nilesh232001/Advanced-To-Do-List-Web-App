```
todo-app/
├── index.html       # HTML layout
├── style.css        # CSS styles and animations

```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Enter a task (and optionally a due date).
2. Click “Add” to insert it into the list.
3. Tasks can be:
   - ✅ Marked as complete
   - ✏️ Edited (double-click)
   - ❌ Deleted
4. If the due date has passed, it is **highlighted** and triggers a **notification** (if permissions are granted).
5. All task data and theme preferences are saved in your browser via **Local Storage**.
